# Phrenology - Another Allegedly Clear Example of Pseudoscience

## History of Neuroscience: The Hear, The Brain and the Mind

### The Cardiac Hypothesis: 
- The heart and circulatory system are the physical basis of mental activity. Aristotle(around 350 BC)
    - heart-rate and emotional states correlate
    - Aristotle believed the brain was a cooling system


### The Brain Hypothesis: 
- The brainand nervois system are the physical basis of mental activity. Galen(AD 129)
- Galen theorises that the  brain has specialized functions in different regions, ie: Speech, Vision, Spatial Navigation, Motor skills, etc.

### The Mind Hypothesis: 
- Mental activity has no physical basis and could not take place in physical stuff. The mind, a non-physical substance, is the non-physical medium of mental activity
    - Descartes(1596 - 1650) - Dualism: the brain is nothing more than an organic transceiver for the mind. Mind is not a complex physical object and has bot parts; whatever it does, it does as one, undivided thing
- Frans Josef Gall (1758 - 1828) and Johann Gasper Spurzheim (1776-1832), the founders of Phrenology, opposed Cartesian Dualism:
    - was a widely accepted theory of how the mind worked
    - was respected by scientists and educated lay people
    - had it's own training programs
    - had application in the care of the diseased and the deviant
    -played a significant economic role
    - had its own journal
    was used as a basis of job hiring and firing decisions
    - was used by politicians to help show their suitability for public office
    - had a positive effect on some social institutions: insane asylums, prinons, and schools

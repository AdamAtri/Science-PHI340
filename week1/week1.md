## What's the nature of Science?

### What's the difference between Science and Pseudoscience?
- pretending to scientific status
- examine: Astrology, Phrenology, Parapsychology, Chinese Acupuncture, UFOlogy, Sexology, Chaos, Paradigms, Creationisms



## Which Theories should be investigated
Science is a race of theories. However, not all theories have prequealified to be in the science race, and should be abandoned very earily in it's "discovery".
### is Astrology Pseudoscience?

#### vvv BAD ARGUMENT vvv
- Astrology is a a pseudoscience because it originated in the supersitions and belief in magic prevalent in ancient times.

Astronomy and Astrology were at one point indestinguishable from one another. Ancient religions were the first systematic attempts to make sense of the order and disorder in the world.
#### vvv BETTER vvv
- Astrology is a pseudoscience because it is stagnant. It has not shown any progress in the past 18 centuries; SCIENCE SHOWS PROGRESS!!

Astrology made progress after the invention of the telescope, incorporating Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto into the purview.
Another, more serious objection, is the fact that once a scientific truth has been discovered further change would be regress, not progress. This might imply that astrology is the most successful science.

#### vvvv EVEN BETTER vvvv
- Astrology is a pseudoscience because there is no known physical mechanism for the incluences it alleges; it claims thtat the very weak forces exerted on us by the planets can strongly incluence our lives and characters, but our current science allows for no such physical possibility

However, while not to defend Astrology, it is clear that weak forces can effect living beings -- example: homing pidgeons
Also, discovery of new phenomnena that have yet to be elucidated

#### vvvv FLAWED vvvv
- Astrology is a pseudoscience because it is not testable: it is not based on observation; because of the alleged complexity of natal horoscopes, any missed prediction can be excused; and its terms are too vague to yield definite predictions.

Astrology is clearly testable since many of its predictions have been tested
